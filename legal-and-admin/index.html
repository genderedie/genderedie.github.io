            		<p >
            			To learn more about completing a Deed Poll, please see below for the age of your transgender family member:
            		</p>
            		
            		<h4>Deed Poll - Under 14 years of age</h4>
            		
            		
            		<p>
						If your family member is under the age of 14 years, the Deed Poll can be executed by one parent with the consent of the other. 
						That is, one parent can complete the Deed Poll process but BOTH parents must consent to the name change.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In order, to complete a Deed Poll for a person aged under 14 years, 
						you must contact the Central Office of the High Court to ask for examples of necessary documents. 
						The Central Office of the High Court is located at the Four Courts, 
						Dublin 7 or on 01 888 6511/6512 or through HighCourtCentralOffice@courts.ie.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Deed Poll - 14-17 years of age</h4>
					
            		<p>
						A young person between the ages of 14 and 17 can execute the Deed Poll themselves. 
						However, they need the consent of BOTH parents.
					</p>
					
					<h4>Deed Poll - 18+ years of age</h4>
            		
            		<p>
            			A person aged 18+ years of age can execute a Deed Poll on their own behalf.

            		<h3>How to Complete a Deed Poll</h3>
            		
            		<p>
            			Please note that if you are a non-EU national, 
            			you will require the permission of the Minister for Justice & Equality to change your name. 
            			The contact details for the Minister are in the further resources section of this website.
            		</p>
            		
            		<p>
            			Please remember a young person requires the consent of BOTH parents to execute a Deed Poll.
            		</p>
            		
            		<ol>
            				<li>
            					<span>The first step in the process is to complete a Deed Poll form. This must be done on Deed Paper, which can be purchased from legal stationers. You can use a Google search to find up-to-date and local legal stationers in your area.</span>
            				</li>
            				<li>
            					<span>Next, choose a witness to the Deed Poll. This person must be over 18 years of age, must sign the Deed Poll, and must be available to swear an affidavit before a solicitor or commissioner for oaths.</span>
            				</li>
            				<li>
            					<span>Next, go to a solicitor or commissioner of oaths in order for the witness to swear the affidavit. This will cost a small fee. There is no set fee for this service so you can call several offices to see which provides the best price.</span>
            				</li>
            				
            				<li>
            					<span>You then must attend in-person the Central Office of the High Court service for personal callers. This service is available only on Tuesdays and Thursday from 10:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. </span>
            				</li>
            				<li>
            					<span>You can now choose whether to ‘Enrol’ your Deed Poll. 
            					The enrolment of a Deed Poll publishes the name change on a publicly accessible record. 
            					This means the wider public is alerted to the name change. It can also be useful for future identification. 
            					It is not required to enrol the Deed Poll in order to change a name. A Deed Poll that is enrolled has no greater effect than one which is not enrolled. 
            					<strong>It is important to know that a person needs an enrolled Deed Poll in order to apply for Gender Recognition under their preferred name.</strong> </span>

						In order for a person aged 16 or 17 years to apply for a Gender Recognition Certificate,

						In order to learn more about this process, please contact the Family Courts.
