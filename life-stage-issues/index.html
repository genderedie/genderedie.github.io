            			My daughter was what we now know to be called 'gender non-conforming' since age three. 
            			We got positive supportive advice from a local psychologist and always offered gender options 
            			re: clothes styles and colours, toys, party themes. 
            			As she got older she became more and more frustrated and upset at being called a 'tomboy’, 
            			‘cos that's a type of girl, not a type of boy'. 
            			More and more often she'd have a meltdown/tantrum for what seemed like a minor 
            			issue and cry and say she was a 'freak, a weirdo, there's no one else in the world like me'. 
            			One [evening] she told me she had the answer, and she knew what she needed me to do…She 
            			asked me to [contact people] to tell them 'she' was now 'he'… I, of course, 
            			should have been a step ahead of him, but I was not. I said, ‘Absolutely, why not? Let's go for it,” 
            			just let's maybe try it at home for a while first to make sure he likes the name etc. 
            			That was me buying time…As a trans-parent, I believe I more often follow and support, than lead. 
            			I'm learning from him. I love him. I'll go wherever that takes me.
