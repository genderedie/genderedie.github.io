### Part 1. Personal stories

In this part, take some time to read stories from families about 
their experience with having a child in their family who is/was gender variant/non-conforming.
  
> My daughter was what we now know to be called 'gender non-conforming' since age three. 
> We got positive supportive advice from a local psychologist and always offered gender options 
> re: clothes styles and colours, toys, party themes. 
> As she got older she became more and more frustrated and upset at being called a 'tomboy’, 
> ‘cos that's a type of girl, not a type of boy'. 
> More and more often she'd have a meltdown/tantrum for what seemed like a minor 
> issue and cry and say she was a 'freak, a weirdo, there's no one else in the world like me'. 
> One [evening] she told me she had the answer, and she knew what she needed me to do…She 
> asked me to [contact people] to tell them 'she' was now 'he'… I, of course, 
> should have been a step ahead of him, but I was not. I said, ‘Absolutely, why not? Let's go for it,” 
> just let's maybe try it at home for a while first to make sure he likes the name etc. 
> That was me buying time…As a trans-parent, I believe I more often follow and support, than lead. 
> I'm learning from him. I love him. I'll go wherever that takes me.
> <footer>Mother of an 8-year old trans child</footer>

> At time of childhood, I just thought my child was a little eccentric. I didn’t think this was a problem.
> <footer>Father of a 24-year old trans young person</footer>

> Looking back over the years, we realised…Oh, that’s why she hated dolls. 
> That’s why she hated getting her Communion Dress. Confirmation clothes was a nightmare! We totally support her and she knows that and feels happy in her own space…
> <footer>Mother of an 16-year old trans young person</footer>

### Part 2. Personal stories

In this part, take some time to read stories from other families about 
their experience with having a transgender adolescent in their family.
  
> I suppose all teenagers have challenging times but for a trans teen the journey to self-acceptance 
> is an enormous struggle. It is emotionally draining at times to share that journey and to stay strong for your child.
> <footer>Mother of a 20-year old trans young person</footer>

> My daughter was 18 when she told us that she was trans…so she kind of fell through the loop a bit. 
> She felt that she was too old to go to BeLonG To. 
> If was left to us as her family to try and find support for her and for us. 
> TENI and TransparenCI were a great help. Even our GP was at a loss of where to go and which routes 
> to follow…It was a huge learning curve for the whole family.
> <footer>Mother of a 20-year old trans young person</footer>

> Teenage years are not pleasant for most of us, 
> so trying to separate how much distress is due to adolescence and how much is 
> due to being trans is very difficult. Very often it felt like transgender 
> was intertwined with everything we did and spoke about as a family and it can be exhausting. 
> We tried very hard as a family to support my son without letting trans issues take over.
> <footer>Mother of a 20-year old trans young person</footer>

> This was more difficult as my child was struggling to come to terms with being trans. 
> After presenting as trans this was a very difficult time for me as I was 
> seeing the change for the first time, i.e. clothes, hair, make-up. 
> Having to go to the school principal to explain [and] also to family and friends.
> <footer>Father of a 24-year old trans young person</footer>

> It is a race against time, isn't it, when you have a teenager who is trans. 
> The constant urgency that surrounds your life all of a sudden to get 
> treatment…It does take over your family’s life for the first two years at least.
> <footer>Mother of an 18-year old trans young person</footer>
