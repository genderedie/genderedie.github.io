            			I thought it would take years for people to accept, for the changes to be made. It only took weeks, and that included engaging with schools, sports clubs, neighbours, pals and family. It was actually an incredibly rewarding and inspirational experience - we got to see the best in so many people.

            			My whole life has changed since we daughter told me she was trans, it has been an emotional roller coaster for the whole family, but it will be worth it when my daughter can finally start to live the life that she was born to have and to see her finally coming out of herself and me happy with who she really is.
