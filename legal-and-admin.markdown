### Part 1. To Learn More

To learn more about completing a Deed Poll, please see below for the age of your transgender family member:

#### Deed Poll - Under 14 years of age

If your family member is under the age of 14 years, the Deed Poll can be executed by one parent with the consent of the other. 
That is, one parent can complete the Deed Poll process but BOTH parents must consent to the name change.

In order, to complete a Deed Poll for a person aged under 14 years, 
you must contact the Central Office of the High Court to ask for examples of necessary documents. 
The Central Office of the High Court is located at the Four Courts, 
Dublin 7 or on 01 888 6511/6512 or through HighCourtCentralOffice@courts.ie.

#### Deed Poll - 14-17 years of age

A young person between the ages of 14 and 17 can execute the Deed Poll themselves. 
However, they need the consent of BOTH parents.

#### Deed Poll - 18+ years of age

A person aged 18+ years of age can execute a Deed Poll on their own behalf.
 
{% endcapture %}
{% include module.html content=module_content number=3 %}

{% capture module_content %} 
### How to Complete a Deed Poll

Please note that if you are a non-EU national, you will require the permission of the Minister for Justice & Equality to change your name. 
The contact details for the Minister are in the further resources section of this website.

Please remember a young person requires the consent of BOTH parents to execute a Deed Poll.

1. The first step in the process is to complete a Deed Poll form. This must be done on Deed Paper, which can be purchased from legal stationers. You can use a Google search to find up-to-date and local legal stationers in your area.
2. Next, choose a witness to the Deed Poll. This person must be over 18 years of age, must sign the Deed Poll, and must be available to swear an affidavit before a solicitor or commissioner for oaths.
3. Next, go to a solicitor or commissioner of oaths in order for the witness to swear the affidavit. This will cost a small fee. There is no set fee for this service so you can call several offices to see which provides the best price.
4. You then must attend in-person the Central Office of the High Court service for personal callers. This service is available only on Tuesdays and Thursday from 10:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 
5. You can now choose whether to ‘Enrol’ your Deed Poll. 
   The enrolment of a Deed Poll publishes the name change on a publicly accessible record. 
   This means the wider public is alerted to the name change. It can also be useful for future identification. 
   It is not required to enrol the Deed Poll in order to change a name. A Deed Poll that is enrolled has no greater effect than one which is not enrolled. 
   **It is important to know that a person needs an enrolled Deed Poll in order to apply for Gender Recognition under their preferred name.** 

To learn how to enrol a Deed Poll, please continue forward by clicking the right arrow.

* Photographic proof of identification.
* €60.00 stamp duty on the Deed Poll.

In order to complete the enrolment process, it is required to first complete the application form to enrol the Deed Poll.

> We have done all of the above. 
> Every department we dealt with have been respectful and helpful in their dealings with us which made the process easier to cope with. 
> The paperwork involved takes up a huge amount of time and mental energy.
> <footer>Mother of a 20-year old trans young person</footer>

> Regarding the Deed Poll, I decided to contact the Deed Poll office by email, get the advice I needed and the templates and paper and type them up myself. I rang our solicitor initially but she had never had to do a Deed Poll before and was very unsure but she did act as Commissioner of Oaths for us and signed and stamped it. We drove to Dublin and entered the Deed Poll office and registered it in the High Court and paid the stamp duty. I contacted the Citizens Identity Services office by phone regarding changing both my sons PPSN's and my 18-year old received his GRC [Gender Recognition Certificate] within a couple of days. 
> We then applied for his passport and the Garda Identity card for proof of age.
> <footer>Mother of an 18-year old trans young person</footer>

> I didn't have any bad experience doing Deed Poll. I got it all done in a week. It was easy.
> <footer>Trans young person</footer>

> Applying for a Deed Poll was surprising easy and straightforward even though he was still under 18, but I found the process incredibly emotional as a mum. He has since applied for and obtained a Gender Recognition Certificate and new birth cert himself within a matter of weeks…I thought that when I saw the new birth cert I would be upset but I wasn't I suppose almost six years on, the sadness and grief I felt has subsided.
> <footer>Mother of a 20-year old trans young person</footer>

> My [child] cannot get a bank account or a passport as he cannot get his 
> GRC [Gender Recognition Certificate] unless I go to court when he turns 18. 
> There is a lot of work involved in getting each stage of the paperwork done, and when one is done, there's another. 
> Every professional we met along the way to help us was wonderful, from our GP, our solicitor to the local Garda. 
> All were very interested and asked plenty questions which we were happy to answer.
> <footer>Mother of a-15 year old trans young person</footer>

> The Deed Poll was tricky in relation to having to go the Four Courts in Dublin twice to enrol it/collect it. 
> The GRC [Gender Recognition Certificate] was very easy to obtain.

### Activity

Now that you’ve learned a bit about the legal and administrative system, 
(if appropriate to their age) consider asking your family member if you can speak to them for a few minutes. 
Ask if they mind discussing with you any concerns they have about their legal documentation. 
If appropriate, ask them if they are intending on legally changing their name or gender or applying for a new passport.

If so, make a plan of action for how you can undertake this task. Refer to the pathways in this module for guidance.
