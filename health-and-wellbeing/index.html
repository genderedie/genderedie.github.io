            			What I did for my mental health was: 
            			1. I stayed around positive, accepted and open-minded people, 
            			2. I worked to keep my mind busy if I got stressed, 
            			3. I workout a lot to get rid of my stress, e.g. running, weights and cycling, 
            			4. [Listening] to music helps, 
            			5. Also went to speak to a counsellor when things got a little tough but it wasn't always about trans.

            		<p>
            			On this page, we have listed a number of key things you may want to know about hormones as relates to transgender young people, 
            			including how to access hormone therapy.
            		</p>
            		
            		<h4>What are hormones and what do they do?</h4>
            		<p>
						Hormones are substances naturally produced by the body. 
						They include sex hormones. The male sex hormone, known as ‘testosterone’, 
						is produced by the testes and the female sex hormone, known as ‘oestrogen’, is produced by the ovaries. 
						Both females assigned at birth and males assigned at birth naturally produce some amounts of both testosterone and oestrogen.
            		</p>
            		<p>
            			“Along with genetic factors, sex hormones affect the development of the reproductive system, 
            			the brain and physical characteristics such as height and build, the way fat is distributed in your body and your muscle bulk.”<sup>1</sup>
            		</p>
            		
            		<p>
            			In general, before birth, 
            			these sex hormones are associated with the development of sex organs 
            			(penis and testicles in males; clitoris, labia, ovaries, uterus, and vagina in females).
            		</p>
            		
            		<p>
            			At puberty, these hormones affect the development of ‘secondary’ sex characteristics. 
            			In males assigned at birth, this includes: both facial, body, and pubic hair; the development of an Adam’s apple; 
            			voice deepening; a growth in the penis and testicles; erections; and increased height and muscle. 
            			In females assigned at birth this includes: the development of breasts; 
            			the onset of periods; the growth of underarm hair and pubic hair; and a more rounded body shape.
            		</p>
            		
            		<h4>Why would transgender young people seek hormone therapy?</h4>
            		<p>
            			Transgender young people may seek hormone therapy to address discomfort they feel in relation to their physical body. 
            			An Endocrinologist is a health care professional who works with hormonal issues.
            		</p>
            		
            		<p>
            			“The aim of hormone therapy is to make you feel more at ease with yourself, both physically and psychologically.<sup>1</sup>”
            		</p>
            		
            		<p>
            			‘Hormone blockers’, or GnRH Analogues (GnRHA), may be used in the early stages of development to ‘block’ the onset of a young person’s puberty. 
            			Hormone blockers may be helpful to trans young people: “1. their use gives adolescents more time to explore their gender variance/nonconformity and other developmental issues and 
            			2. to facilitate transition by preventing the development of sex characteristics that are difficult or impossible to reverse if adolescents continue on to pursue sex reassignment<sup>2</sup>”. 
            			They are not prescribed until after first stages of puberty (known as ‘Tanner stage 2’).
            		</p>
            		
            		<p>
            			‘Cross-sex hormones’ are hormones which are prescribed to masculinise or feminise the body and affect the sex characteristics described in the section above.
            		</p>
            		
            		<h4>Are there any risks to hormone therapy?</h4>
