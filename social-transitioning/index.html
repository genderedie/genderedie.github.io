            			Oh my god, this was so hard at the beginning…I found it very confusing to stick to their male pronoun and name 
            			since I've been using a female pronoun to describe them for the past 15 years! 
            			I had to recondition myself into using their new name and male pronouns. 
            			As the weeks progressed we all got the hang of it and we told our four year old son that their new name was a nickname that they prefer to be called from now on, 
            			and they got it! He thought it was cool and fun! Then we corrected our four year old gently when they used female pronouns. 
            			With my husband there was a lot more work to be done there as he is 'old school' and very innocent to this new world he was being flung into.

            			It's also hard to just to try and forget the birth name, 
            			the one that you had chosen for your child. The pronouns are a little easier than the name and there was lots of mistakes the first few weeks, 
            			but it does get easier, and our youngest child is always around to correct us.

            			I hated the name he had chosen but I love it now. 
            			The name is not the hardest part to get used to but the pronoun is almost impossible because it is something we do innately and don't really think about.

            			<p>
            				The social aspects of transitioning are an important part of not only your transgender family member’s life and wellbeing, but also the entire family. 
            				There is no one size fits all path for social transitioning. 
            				It is often a process of the young person and the family figuring things out as they go. 
            				It will likely take time and patience on everyone’s part to work through this process. 
            				As long as you are all coming from a place of respect and support, 
            				it is hoped you can successfully navigate these processes.
